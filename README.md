Reminders to run on a new Mac running osx on apple silicon

# Preamble: Homebrew, git, and iterm

Very first thing is to run `git` so we can start downloading apple dev tools. Once that's done, we can start with everything else.

```bash
brew install iterm2
brew install xz     # Helps to install pyenv/poetry later

brew install graphviz  # Needed to make directed graphs with pygraphviz
```
